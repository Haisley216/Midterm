				<p class="m_text">Story about the food</p>
				<p class="cont">When she was younger, she studied abroad in Sweden for six months, and while she was initially excited about her first time abroad, the reality was different. Living in a place where she didn't know anyone and had to speak a language that wasn't her native tongue was harder than she expected. She felt lonely and isolated, and because she wasn't familiar with the local food, she often skipped proper meals and filled her stomach with jelly-like snacks.
				<br>
				Then one day, her neighbor told her that she had made too much food and offered to give her some meatballs. She gratefully accepted, but didn't have high expectations, as she had tried Swedish meatballs before but always found them too salty. But when she took a bite, she was surprised at how delicious they were. For the first time in days, her appetite returned, and she felt like she had finally eaten a proper meal and felt revived.
				<br>
				Those meatballs, with their neighbor's warmth, became the food she missed most, and that memory inspired her to eventually become a chef specializing in Swedish cuisine.
